# Titanic Survival Prediction – Data Analysis & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to identify key factors that influenced survival and builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival outcomes.

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling skills commonly required for Data Analyst roles.
