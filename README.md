# Titanic Survival Prediction – Data Analysis & Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic passenger dataset and building a machine learning model to predict survival outcomes. The objective is to understand key factors affecting survival and apply predictive modeling techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic competition.
- train.csv – training data
- test.csv – test data
- gender_submission.csv – sample submission format

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction and submission generation

## Machine Learning Model
A supervised machine learning model was trained to predict passenger survival. The trained model was saved using joblib for reuse.

## Output
- submission.csv – final prediction file
- final_model.joblib – saved trained model

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis and machine learning workflow, making it suitable for real-world predictive analytics tasks.
